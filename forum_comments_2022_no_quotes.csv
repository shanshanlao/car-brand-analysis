According to one article I saw, things aren\'t likely to truly get back to ""normal,"" whatever that is, probably until the second half of 2023. If true, this will likely mean that there won\'t be a sudden collapse of car prices. With all the lost production and pent up demand we\'ve got, used and new vehicle prices are likely to remain high for the first half of 2022, and then only slowly start to decline after that. And so in 6 months or so when your Maverick hybrid arrives you should still be able to pocket a handy profit on your 2.0 Maverick as you make the trade. ']"

Most people I know are not paying any attention to car prices, so I haven’t been hearing much. I do read the news regularly, and they talk about supply chain problems, and I do purchase computer parts and build computer systems, so I’m aware the chip shortage is still a thing. This week I received another of those “private offers” from Ford, offering me $2,500 towards the purchase of a new F150.', 'This inspired me to get online and look around. Truecar says the average price paid for a new Supercrew F150 XLT is more than $800 over MSRP. Needless to say, that does not inspire me to buy a new truck. The old 2013 work truck that I bought last May is doing just fine. And Carvana says it’s increased in value by more than a thousand dollars since I bought it. Insanity! Who would have ever thunk that a car/truck would be an appreciating asset, like a house? ', 'I just read through the last 10 pages of this forum, and I see many of you are buying cars despite the insanity. I also see speculation (both ways) on whether the situation will ever go back to where it was previously, large supplies of cars on the dealer lots and big discounts on many models. On that front, I did see an article recently, don’t remember where, about the car manufacturers wanting to move Americans in the direction of European car buyers who typically order their new cars instead of buying off the lot. If they could pull that off, it would deemphasize the role of the new car dealers, which is something the manufacturers have wanted to do for many years. Thoughts?', ' ']"

Remember with inflation if a product goes up 10% then their tax take also goes up 10%. They LOVE inflation. If and when your salary increases then their cut also increases.

But if one turns up in my preferred color/options combo, I\'d definitely go check it out as why not get it now if they have this ""unicorn"" I seem to want. Did see one in red yesterday on I-95 and kind of liked it but not sure after a few years if I\'d still feel the same way. I know that Windchill Pearl color will never get old with me and on this vehicle, I\'m not going to settle one bit, I want it spec\'d out the way I want, definitely no AWD either. Shame I can\'t order one but guess they don\'t do that either. But one would think somewhere out there, there is a Windchill Pearl unit with the 2-tone interior with the JBL Package plus a roof. Seems to be a simple enough combination to be honest but again, have no issues waiting. But would rather trade the Golf when it has zero issues going on...like now.', ""Will do some online searching later as I know Toyota of Hollywood seems to be a pretty large dealer and not super far from us. Pretty sure I can get the 2 years free maintenance at any Toyota store I'd hope. So maybe time to start my search."", ""Also plan on checking out the Hyundai Kona plus the Kia Seltos and compare them all.

The EPA estimates that the hybrid powertrain is good for 42 mpg city and 33 mpg highway, big boosts over the 23/30 city/highway figures earned by the front-wheel-drive nonhybrid variant. In our 75-mph highway fuel-economy test, we recorded 30 mpg for the hybrid, which is only 1 mpg higher than the nonhybrid Maverick. However, during everyday driving, where the hybrid system can take advantage of regenerative braking and more heavily lean on the electric side of the powertrain, we recorded 32 mpg. Comparing our observed fuel economy opens the door to a lot of caveats, but if you compare that 32 mpg to the most efficient Ranger we\'ve tested, an XL 4x2 model that averaged 19 mpg back in 2019, there\'s some eye-opening arithmetic.

No more adm. In fact, in 1986 most Honda dealers started discounting big from msrp. I remember screamer ads in the LA Times classifieds in 1986 from Honda dealers competing with each other to sell Accords. They sold every one, and it soon became the best selling car in America—but discounted from msrp. Same reality held true when I got my first new Accord in 2002 for more than $4000 off msrp.', ""Now Tesla is in a different and better position than Honda was then, because they don't yet really have competitors. In 1985 if there was an ADM on an Accord you could just go buy another gas car instead. But even now there's not much choice if you don't get a Tesla. The waiting list for a Model Y is 6 months or so, but the waiting list for a VW ID.4 is 9 months or so. "", ""Anyway, even in 2021 Fremont was exporting half of its production to other parts of the world, but with the Berlin factory open that's no longer needed, which is why Tesla sales have already more than doubled in the US in the first three months of this year. "", ""And now slowly but surely the Death Star of the Austin factory is going to ramp up to full power. When that happens it will not only affect Tesla's competitors but also Tesla itself, because the basic economics of supply and demand will eventually take hold as EV supplies go from tiny to huge over the next three years. This is especially true because it's not just Tesla expanding production. Ford, GM, and everyone else have all launched crash programs of almost World War II dimensions to convert production from gas cars to EVs, and floods of those EVs from everyone will all hit the market starting in 2025."", ""Anyway, my 2 cents from all this is that if you don't yet have an EV you might want to wait a few years. Deals should be good if you can wait for supplies to catch up with demand. ""]"

There are some parallels between the way Henry Ford engineered and mass-manufactured the Model T and what's going on today with the Model 3 and Model Y. Ford was hugely invested in vertical integration, owning mines, glass factories, rubber plants, etc., and when that worked it helped with the quality and price of a Ford. Ford was also obsessed with factories and production processes, and ramping things up to huge numbers. As we know, Tesla is similarly invested, by necessity, in controlling all the phases of the production of batteries, as well as all of the other components that go into a Tesla. And Musk is also obsessed with factories and manufacturing. And like the Model T, which looked pretty much the same for more than 15 years, Tesla goes for long product cycles with running improvements along the way. He's seemingly ditched the whole planned stylistic obsolescence that GM pioneered back in the 1920s and 1930s."", 'Musk recently said: “At this point, I think I know more about manufacturing than anyone currently alive on Earth.”', 'He might be right, even though the quality of Tesla vehicles has sometimes been mixed.

2022-04-18 14:12:00,benjaminh,"['\n', '\nMusk is often right about electric cars, but when it comes to some of the other goals....?? Yesterday this 1-hour TED interview with Musk was released that covers all sorts of issues, many of them non-automotive.', 'I watched most of it at 1.75 speed, and here are some of the things that were said:', 'Musk predicts Tesla\'s self-driving might be released by the end of 2022. I guess we can believe it when we see it. But he seems to have dramatically lowered his own safety goals for self-driving. I think all he said in this new interview is that self-driving should be safer than a human driver. But back in 2016 Musk wrote: ""Develop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning.""', ""So seemingly the goal has gone from 10 times safer than a human driver to maybe 1.5X? That doesn't sound good."", 'Others things covered in the interview include:', ""According to Musk, the AI Optimus robot from Tesla will probably be getting close to being like an Asimov robot in ten years or so. Seems unlikely. But if it does happen unemployment is mentioned by the interviewer as a side effect. Don't worry about it, Musk says. Okay. "", ""Probably Musk's biggest goal is getting humans to Mars by 2029—and then after that sending thousands of colonizing and supply missions to Mars in the 2030s and beyond. He's ramping up production of rockets for this now. The goal is to create a self-sustaining city of million on Mars at some point, so that if civilization dies on Earth intelligence can go on. When the interviewer asks who is likely to volunteer to go to Mars, Musks admits not many will want to go. Going to Mars will be very cramped, very difficult, very dangerous, and (although it's not quite said in this way) you probably won't have the life span you would have on Earth."", 'Anyway....Getting back to cars. Although I think overall Tesla has been good, I personally don\'t want a Tesla for a few reasons. First, I like driving, and so I\'m personally against so-called ""AI"" driving my car. Since I\'m not going to use self-driving, I also don\'t want to pay for the $5k or whatever it costs to have all the cameras and computer power built into the car for that purpose. I also don\'t like a glass roof without a shade, especially since we have a family member with chronic migraines who is bothered by bright lights and the sun. ', ""I feel a bit guilty about it, but I see some advantages to driving a gas car while things transition to EVs. One is financial. By keeping my car for ten years or more rather than being an EV first adopter I can save tens of thousands of dollars. Seems also likely that as EVs are adopted in huge numbers starting in 2025 that demand for gas will slowly start to fall, and then maybe the price per gallon will also start to fall. Finally, I've got a highway range that's more than EVs costing more than 100k. Since my bucket list includes taking some big road trips, holding off on getting an EV seems good for that. But yes, I am concerned about global warming. ""]"

Keep in mind that my wife still has not returned to work since getting sick from Covid in January. 16.3 MPG average. I filled up the Jeep this AM 27.5 mpg. ', ""I haven't shared much of anything that's been going on with my life and family since January. It is honestly too much to type and I'm sure I'm going to leave a lot out. Literally the day Covid symptoms hit my wife, my Dad (Whom I am in business with) broke his ankle. So I have a small business to run and can't be home to take care of my wife or help her get our children (15, 13, & 10) off to their 3 different schools in the AM. My wife is currently suffering from Long Covid Symtoms. She has been diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety, & Depression. Along with medication, she currently sees a private Therapist 1x a week and is enrolled in an IOP (Intensive Outpatient Program) Group Therapy 3 days a week for 4 hours. Her anxiety is so bad that is causing her to have chest pressure. Twice she has been to the hospital because she thought she was having a heart attack. "", 'My 13 year old son was having difficulties at school which he didn\'t tell us about. As far as we know, nothing was directly happening to him. The middle school we are districted for has a lot of students that attend the school from less desirable parts of our fair city. Many of these children were literally watching TV, You Tube, or playing video games for the past 2+ years while the schools were all remote, then transitioned to Hybrid. Since many of these students suffered educational loss, the district decided to eliminate the honors program and make every kid an honors student. They call it Honors for all. My 7th Grader has been an Honors student (he gets his brains and good looks from my wife). The teachers spent a significant amount of time disciplining the kids and reviewing material that my son learned in 5th grade. Aside from being disruptive in the classroom, these kids are also very loud and physical with each other in the hallways in-between classes. My son has some sort of hyper sensitivity sensory issue going on. The fighting in the hallways and other kids being disruptive in the class made him not want to go to school. As crazy as this sounds, he was diagnosed with a condition called ""school refusal"" in addition to anxiety and depression. He missed 20+ days of school. So while my wife was sick with Covid, she spent hours trying to wake my son up and get him to school. He was literally sleeping for 12 - 15 hours and not eating. We fought with the school and the school district to get my son transferred to another middle school and were successful. This brought on its own set of problems. My wife went over one of the associate superintendent\'s head to get our son the help and change he needed. This didn\'t sit well with this woman who attended the transition meeting and proceeded to call DCF (Department of Child & Family Services) on us. This only added to my wife\'s anxiety problem. My wife is the PTO President at our daughter\'s school and had to leave a PTO event she was running to meet the DCS worker at our house with 20 minutes notice on a Friday when she was supposed to be away for a Temple women\'s retreat. Due to the volume of children with mental health issues we haven\'t been able to get my son a Therapist until last week. ', 'Last year, my older son (now 15 and a sophmore) suffered a severe concussion while playing ice hockey last year. While he has recovered physically from the concussion, it uncovered some severe anxiety and depression issues he was having. He\'s been in Therapy for a little over a year now. Since his concussion, we have been trying to figure out that something was ""off"" with him. He was recently diagnosed as being on the Autism Spectrum. We had to pay for testing which was expensive and hire a lawyer to help us navigate the school district\'s ""Special Education"" gauntlet. We have been fighting with the district for help and there is finally some light at the end of the tunnel.', 'Our 10 year old daughter has had issues with other children bullying her at school.

Adam over at the Rare Classic Cars YouTube channel posted an interview he did with Bob Lutz (at age 90!) last weekend and he talked about his time at BMW in the early ‘70s. Their new cars were in demand and they could not produce enough to satisfy it so dealers and export markets were on allocation. They discovered a number of cars coming into German dealers for warranty work that were listed on their records as being exported. Investigation revealed that some staff in the export department were greasing the wheels with cash to have the intended dealer or foreign importer redirect those cars back to them for sale as nearly new used cars. Those individuals got fired. He said the company was rife with corrupt practices back then. ']

If you instead went from 90% to 10% that preserves your battery but takes off 20%, which would mean that now your EV with a theoretical range of 270 miles is down to a real-world of about 160 miles. Right now I regularly drive between Louisville and Columbus, which is a distance of 220 miles."", '""How to prolong your electric car battery’s life', '1. Don’t overcharge it: constantly topping up your electric car to keep it fully charged can actually damage it. Laptops, for example, lose battery capacity if they\'re plugged in all the time. It\'s better to let the capacity run down to 10 or 20%, then recharge to around 80%.""', 'Car and Driver found that maintenance costs on their long-term Model 3 were not far from gas cars once you include tire replacements at 30k rather than 50k. At the end of 3 years the battery of their long-term tester had lost 7% of its range. ', '""The Model 3 has minimal scheduled service. However, one regional requirement that applies to us is lubricating the oft-dormant brake calipers every year or 12,500 miles in areas where roads are salted during winter. Those three lubes each cost oil-change money, totaling $306. But our car\'s minuscule brake wear over 40,000 miles suggests the pads should last well past 100,000 miles. The Model 3\'s all-season Michelin tires, on the other hand, were used up after just 30,000 miles, partially because the Tesla version of this tire has less tread depth, probably for a slight boost in efficiency and range. A new set was $1157....Like a cellphone battery, the lithium-ion packs that power today\'s EVs lose their ability to hold energy over time. The big questions are how much and how quickly. Two things that accelerate the falloff are lots of fast-charging and charging all the way to 100 percent, both of which we did quite often. Using third-party software called TeslaFi, we could nerd out on all kinds of data about our car\'s driving and charging, as well as monitor its battery loss. At the 20,000-mile halfway point of our test, our car showed about a 6 percent loss, or a 19-mile range reduction."" ']"

Under the proposed rule, issued by the California Air Resources Board, the state will require 35 percent of new passenger vehicles sold in the state by 2026 to be powered by batteries or hydrogen.

They are a smaller outfit up there and only work 5 days a week. Unlike us, they have to put in a request to work the following week, 3 days, and not stuck in a schedule like we are here down south. I like the idea of working different days week to week depending on one's schedule outside of work. We weren't given that choice as our boss asked us what days we wanted to work & he did his best giving us them. Our lead is no longer working on Wednesdays so have no clue what group I'll be with next week.

I rode down there and met some of the guys. They were painting a pretty good picture of the CR England program. It took me about 20 minutes to walk up to one of the CR England reps and I said ""Hey, I signed up for this but I no longer want to take this training.""', '""Umm...OK.""', '""Do I owe you guys anything?""', '""No.""', '""I\'ll bet I have to pay my way back to Idaho.""', '""Yes, we won\'t pay your way back home.""', ""And that was it.

Seller/manufacturer seems very competent but also doesn't have the best bedside manner: approx. $1,800, I'd have to install it. Available to ship within a week or so. 2 year warranty. "", ""2. Aftermarket lithium ion conversion: approx. $2,200, I'd have to install it. Available to ship next month. 2 year warranty. I have concerns about putting lithium ion in a vehicle which wasn't designed for it, but the people who have this upgrade seem to really like it. "", '3. Aftermarket rebuilt battery, sketchy seller with fake Google reviews which was recently acquired by a very large aftermarket parts company: approx. $1,700, they install pretty much nationwide.

Local-ish battery rebuilder, same rebuilder who rebuilt my pack (for the car's previous owner) before it failed 11 months later: approx. $950, they install. 6 month full warranty and an additional 6 months prorated, but the terms of the warranty state it's invalid if you have CEL, which my car does, due to a worn out catalytic converter. I'd expect you'd have to have the pack rebuilt every year or so, just after the warranty expires. "", '5. OEM Toyota battery, unsure of cost, but very likely higher than all of the above, and some dealers may not want to sell the part alone. There are some vague references to the dealerships expecting the core back within 24 hours, which is doable, but also very annoying. 3 year warranty.

When the store I preferred to shop at had a suit sale I would always take a look and sometimes buy. This one time they had a sale and I saw a suit in my size that I thought would fit right in, a nice gray wool fabric with a very subtle stripe from a good manufacturer. I bought a tie that seemed to go with it and the salesguy agreed. I wore that suit for at least 2 years before someone complimented me on my nice taupe suit. Now, taupe is a total non-color for me. Since I really can't see it, I think it looks gray in most of its shades until it spills over to the brown side and becomes beige.

I floored it at 75 mph and there was an extended pause before the transmission decided on a gear and took off. My 2er would have left if for dead."", ""Brakes- A bit more touchy than the BMW brakes I'm used to, but I could easily adapt. Like BMW, M-B is cutting costs and using floating calipers at the rear.

The only receipt I couldn't find were the set of Bridgestone run flat tires I had for a few years there. Guessing I threw it out after I put the current Goodyear Eagle GT's on, don't know why I even did that. Come next month, these tires will be 3 years old and on October 1st, the Interstate battery will be 2 years old. Batteries down south here generally last between 2 to 3 years and I know last time, it died in our garage like the A3 did 2 weeks ago. This time, I won't wait till it dies to replace it and will probably swap it out within the next 6 months."", ""I know a few months ago, someone in here asked me how much maintenance I've had to do on the Golf as I was talking about getting something new. Bought the car on 12/12/14 with 15 miles on it. The water pump/thermostat were replaced within miles of the warranty ending, at 35,958 miles but also noticed that the first battery died at 22,942 miles on 10/18/16...didn't even go for a full two years of ownership! Besides the usual oil changes/tire rotations, the only at fault, with my wife directing me, was the $729 charge to replace the passengers side view mirror right after Hurricane Irma in 2017. "", ""Here are charges that I think VW should've helped me with and were no fault of human error. There was the drivers door defective lock in 6/19, they charged $139 to straighten out some cable as the key fob wouldn't unlock the front door. They told me it got kinked somehow in that small area in the drivers door which seemed odd to me and they refused to assist me in any way. In June of 2020,the engine gasket had a leak which my mechanic fixed for $360 after VW again refused to help. Lastly, towards the end of 2020,the right front axle assembly needed replacing, a $537 charge done at my mechanic as I was just shy of 65K."", ""And now with just about 72K on the clock, that's about it to speak of. Am lucky if I drive it 40 miles/week now and have just decided to stop looking for something else. Looking at what I've spent out of pocket in the almost eight years of ownership, it really isn't that much to speak of and to be honest, nothing out there besides the Mini Cooper that really excites me to change into. Not much out there I'm really interested in, so will just wait and see what the future brings. Probably, something will just fall in my lap that will finally make me want a change. But, as of now, nothing like that has happened so will do nothing going forward except possibly swap out the battery for a new one. ""]"

I have tried changing the drive mode to ""dynamic,"" and that didn\'t seem to help. I may try driving with the transmission in S instead of D. When I had the GLI (with a six speed DSG), all that seemed to do was essentially apply the same shift program, but kept the car in one lower gear than it would otherwise be in D, which would help, but may not be ideal.

That was done at a regular Goodyear store. The Tires Choice is affiliated with Goodyear and not a Goodyear owned store from what I was told. Not sure what you said about a 3d party is correct in this case but if I have another nail puncture, I'll just go back to where I bought them and see what happens. I do know that I doubt I'll ever buy a Goodyear tire in the future as they make it too difficult honestly...I've never had an issue at Tires Plus/Firestone when it comes to using the road hazard warranty. If the tire wasn't patchable, they'd pro-rate it, add on a new road hazard fee and send me on my way with a brand new balanced tire. And down here, They are both all over the place. I just wanted to try the Goodyear Assurance tire this time but the sales guy said I'd do better with the Eagle GT's and he showed me that he had them on his VW GTI.

Since it's staying in the stable for the next year or so, it was money well spent. And so much easier working under the hood now that the strut works as intended & I no longer need another pair of hands to do anything under the hood. Overall, the paint is looking really good as it hasn't been waxed in a long long time. I used to have it done at least 3 times a year at a local car wash but haven't had it done in like 8 months now. Found some older wax product in the garage, a spray on kind of foam and am amazed at how well the front hood looks since. Water beads up immediately and since I'm doing it myself, doing it in stages so as not to injure my back again. Also, parking it in the garage every night also helps in keeping the paint in good overall condition. "", ""Have to say, the Golf is still putting that sh-t-eating grin on my face whenever I see it still, a good sign I suspect! This has to be the one vehicle I've owned that I really like the best!!

I've had a nice summer/fall of looking and test driving (oh, no. Another LD ramble forthcoming):"", ""'15 Porsche Boxster: Anthracite Brown over Luxor Beige. Drove on a gorgeous summer day, temp ~80 with no clouds. Unfortunately, a very nice but somewhat nervous owner of the small used car dealer in coastal CT rode shotgun. Not that I would have done anything untoward, of course. Me gusto mucho, while not the torquiest of drives, the handling and nice ride were impressive (yeah, big surprise there). I left, strongly considering it; the price was the price. And, while not unreasonable (in these times), with taxes/fees it would have been ~$4k above my already thrice raised spending limit. Eventually, it sold, perhaps to my regret."", 'Went to Mohegan Sun after the test drive, to try to win the extra $4k playing blackjack.

Test drove 2x, first on a cold and wet day, still lowered the top in between deluges... Great sport seats, nice sound for a turbo four. Great ride and handling. Reasonable price. But, noticeable squeaks and rattles from over my left shoulder (and it wasn't the seat belt apparatus) and some, at least perceived, noise from the front end. Asked sales dude to take it for a ride and see what he heard. He did a few days later with a tech, unsurprisingly, they heard nothing."", 'So, on another day, sunny, went with the wife to drive it again. Fun, fun, fun in the sun with a lovely blond riding shotgun. But, and she noticed right away, a rattling from the passenger side dashboard and her window; window down, no rattle. Window up, much rattle. Not glove box-related for other rattle, somewhere in the dash. Price had been lowered, thought about it, realized it was a used car, but the rattles likely would only get worse, that would drive me nuts. It, too, a few weeks later sold. Less regrets.', ""'18 Mercedes C300: Blue over chocolate (whatever the light brown, not beige MB calls it, MBTex. Love that color, whether Audi, BMW or MB). Certified, more expensive than the above Bimmer. Tested it on a lovely day, with the wife. Nice ride, if not as smooth as I would have thought a MB would be (AMG handling pkg). Not quite the grin-handling of the BMW, and the engine sounded a bit coarse. But, luxurious, well crafted interior (and air scarf!). Handsome little beast, but did not set my heart a flutter. Still, a contender. "", 'Funny aside, I crawled into the back seat to check it out, as I was getting out of the passenger side, I reached for the open door for balance and the sales dude pulled the door back ""to give me more room to exit,"" and I crashed to the ground ignominiously, mildly bloodying my left knee. And, pride. I got the feeling he liked my so-much better half, not so much me. Price went down $1k a few days later, and I believe it sold today. No regret.', ""'18 BMW M240xi: White over chocolate. Certified. Other than a lot of road rash on the wheels, which salesmeister said they would machine out, pre-sale, and tires he immediately noted they would replace, excellent shape. I don't think I even have to describe the ride, all here know of the glory of the sound and torque of the I6 bubbling under the hood."", 'So, you can guess what happened next: Punch!

I of course, filled my pockets with treats from the canteen... that'll show 'em."", 'Actually got a decent (these days) deal: $3700 below MSRP, but, as you may remember, add $1k mop & glo/scotchgard package (ok, ""ceramic coating"" which should last for years, no waxing required. And, if something evil happens, dealer will clean at no cost). So, net $2700 under msrp. I\'m good with that. And, we took the Carmax offer on the \'19 CX-5, it took much too long at the closest Carmax to get the deal done, but they honored the offer, less the small payoff of her loan.

It's got a similar 4 cylinder turbo as my VW Golf has but there's no turbo lag like I seem to have, none that I experienced in the 60 or so miles I drove. With about 74,200 on the clock, it drives very nicely and holds the road well. Am assuming Audi tweaks that 1.8 engine a bit differently than the one in my Golf and I do prefer the A3's version much better. Did sit in a brand new A3 at work, and prefer the new dashboard as it's more modern without that ridiculous pop-up infotainment screen coming up from the top of the dash. A much simpler design than our 2015 model and even the front fascia has evolved nicely. Just unfortunate that the intro price is now so much higher than what we paid back in December of 2014. Yes, ours will be eight years of ownership come December 1st later this week, bought with maybe 10 miles on the clock. Aside from the oil/coolant leaks, overeall, we've liked it a whole lot. ""]"

I keep telling her that in the recirculate mode on, the inside air will be a bit colder and that smelly outside air one sometimes goes through won't come into the cabin. She still won't believe me."", ""Last night on the way home from dinner at the Crab House in Boynton Beach, excellent restaurant, we passed an area where the outside air stunk. She immediately asked me if I needed to stop & use the men's room. Of course I said no, the smelly outside air came into the cabin due to you keeping the recirculating button off. Told her this is the reason mine is always on. The funny part is, when we left the house, I pressed the recirculating button on as I drive that way but since it was her vehicle, she turned it right off which kind of pissed me off. Again, for the hundredth time, I slowly & calmly explained how the recirculating system works."", ""Now she's lived through it first hand but guessing she still believes the sales guy over me & experiencing how it works on the way home tonight. Gets frustrating when I'm proven right, for once, but she still won't believe what I say. That's a big reason I usually have her drive when we take her vehicle out as I prefer the cleaner colder air in our South Florida heat. A shame that some folks just hate being told they are wrong on something but after being shown the truth, still believing the falsehood, something that's very prevalent in our society today!!! ""]"

I'm sure the Kona N will be a hoot to drive & put that silly grin on my face, but so will the Countryman which I might like a bit more. Warranty wise, Kona N is the clear winner here and think it's reliability will be so much better. Basing that on the three Hyundai vehicles that we've owned in the past and presently.

I'm not sure whether mine was reset when the Maverick was delivered, but it now shows 86% oil life remaining with 1,653 miles on the clock.
